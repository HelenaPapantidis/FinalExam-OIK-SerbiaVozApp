**FinalExamProject OiK SeleniumFramework**


In my final exam project, I conducted end-to-end (E2E) testing on the SrbijaVoz application, focusing on three critical functionalities: registration, login, and ticket reservation. The project was developed using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, with Selenium for browser automation, Java as the programming language, and TestNG as the testing framework. Testing Focus: Registration Test: This test verifies that a user can successfully register for an account on the SrbijaVoz platform. The test includes filling out the necessary fields, submitting the registration form, and confirming that the user is redirected to the appropriate post-registration page.

Login Test: This test ensures that users can log in to their accounts using valid credentials and invalid credential email. It validates that after entering the username and password, users are successfully logged in and redirected to the dashboard or home page and sistem behavior message when usin invalid mail input.

Ticket Reservation Test: The final test checks the end-to-end functionality of the ticket reservation process. It simulates searching for train schedules, selecting a desired train, entering passenger details, and completing the booking. The test also verifies that a booking confirmation is displayed at the end of the process.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement end-to-end tests for web applications using industry-standard tools and practices. The use of Selenium, Java, TestNG, and the Page Object Model ensures that the tests are maintainable and scalable, providing reliable validation of the core functionalities of the SrbijaVoz application.
